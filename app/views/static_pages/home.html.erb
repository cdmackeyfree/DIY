      <p>Do you ever just want to sew with no project in mind? The impulse to create has a tendency to sneak up on one.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you are eyeing a specific design on <a href="https://www.spoonflower.com"> Spoonflower</a> but you can't think of something to make.</p>
      <p> Or maybe you are looking for ways to use up your fabric stash?</p>
      <p> Fear not! No matter the size of fabric, there is a project that can be done.</p>
      <p>Just click on the size of fabric you are working with!</p>
