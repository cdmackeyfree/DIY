        <!--  Created a table to display the suggestions once they are made.
        The first line shows the suggestion title and links to that suggestion's show page.
        Pluralize is  used to makes sure that the votes display as votes if there is more than one.
        button_to makes a button for voting, upvote_suggestion_path(suggestion) returns the amount of votes
        so that it is keeping track of click on each button visably on the page by using post. That is
        followed by a hidden delete button that is only visible when the admin is toggled to show it. The class
        admin is set to display: none in CSS and uses jQuery to toggle -->
